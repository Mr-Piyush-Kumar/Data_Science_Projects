## Project Name:- Segmenting and Clustering of Neighborhoods in Toronto City

### Completed By:- Piyush Kumar

In this project I have clustered the neighbourhoods of Toronto city in a particular area so that if a user plan to shift in that area, he/she has the knowledge of neighbourhoods in that area.
