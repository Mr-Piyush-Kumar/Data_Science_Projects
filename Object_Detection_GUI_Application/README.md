This is the project which I have created for one of my client who was in the final year of his graduation to submit to pass the final semester. In this project I have created an application which can take any image and detect objects in image. This application can detect upto 1000 types of objects. There are some features in application like there are two option to select which model to use for object detection and also there is feature to adjust threshold level. Watch below video to understand all the features of the application.
