## Project Name:- Human Protein Atlas - Single Cells Classification  

### Completed By:- Piyush Kumar    
    
In this project client wanted to build and compare three deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet and DenseNet) for human protien cells classification into 19 different class labels and find the best model for the deployment.

The task was to build three deep learninig models using FastAi and Python for image segmentation and classify each segmented cells in the image in 19 different provided class labels. The Training data size was of 158 GB which was impossible to process on local hardware so I just took 20 % of data randomly keeping the classes balanced and then found the best model using 20% of the traininig data then after it we deployed and trained it in AWS EC2.
